Contractors can showcase their services and insurance credentials, while customers can easily find and hire trusted professionals. Whether you're a contractor looking to expand your clientele or a customer seeking peace of mind, Insured Contractors has you covered.**

## User-Friendly Interface

## Technologies We Use
Behind the scenes, we leverage cutting-edge technologies to make your experience seamless and secure:
- MongoDB: We store our contractor data securely and efficiently using MongoDB, ensuring fast and reliable access to information.
- Node.js: Our backend is powered by Node.js, providing a robust and scalable foundation for our platform.
- Next.js: We use Next.js for our frontend, delivering a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Stretch Features We Would Plan to Include
- [ ] Advanced Search Filters: Implement advanced search filters such as budget range, project type, years of experience, and more to help users narrow down their contractor search further.
- [ ] User Profiles: Create detailed user profiles for contractors and customers. Include options for contractors to showcase their portfolios and certifications.
- [ ] Users can only edit and delete posts or delete comments by entering the secret key, which is set by the user during post-creation
- [ ] Mobile App: Expand your reach by developing mobile applications for iOS and Android, offering users a convenient way to access the platform on their smartphones and tablets.

And more to come!!
